  <figcaption>I'm a fourth year PhD student at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences. I'm interested in understanding the <b>whole</b> human genome architecture, its diversity, and the consequence (phenotype, traits, etc) and evolution of such a structure. My current research is on human genome assembly and structural variation. Two areas that I primarily focus on are tandem repeats which underly several neurological disorders and the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus which contains the genes necessary to make an individual's antibody repertoire.</figcaption>
