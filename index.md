<br><p>I'm a fourth year PhD student at the 
Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences. I'm primarly interested in understanding the **whole** human genome architecture, and not just the consequence (phenotype, traits, etc) of such a structure but understanding why it is the way it is (history). My current research includes resolving "complex" regions of the human genome with a primary focus on tandem repeat loci and the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus.</p>
